Outstanding sourdough crust,2024-04-12,5,"Their naturally leavened sourdough crust has a tang that pairs beautifully with the savory toppings. Light, airy, and blistered just right. Could eat this plain and still be thrilled."
Slow service on a busy night,2024-03-18,3,"We waited nearly 45 minutes for our pizza on a Friday night. Staff was apologetic, but it threw off our evening plans. Pizza was decent, but not worth that wait time."
Best mushroom truffle pie,2024-05-07,5,"If you like earthy flavors, their wild mushroom and truffle oil pizza is a must. Loaded with porcini and shiitake, finished with a drizzle of white truffle oil. Luxurious without being heavy."
Disappointing gluten-free,2024-04-03,2,"Their gluten-free crust tasted like cardboard — dry and crumbly. Toppings were fine, but the base ruined it. Gluten-free eaters deserve better."
Perfect for kids,2024-03-22,4,"We brought our twins here for dinner and they loved getting to watch the pizzas being made. The simple cheese pizza was a hit. Great family vibe."
Way too oily,2024-04-30,2,"The pizza was swimming in oil, especially around the edges where it pooled on the plate. Made it tough to enjoy even though the flavors were alright."
Incredible creative toppings,2024-06-01,5,"Just tried their roasted peach, prosciutto, and basil pizza. Sounds odd, but it worked beautifully. Sweet, salty, and herbal all balanced perfectly."
Not worth the hype,2024-05-04,3,"Everyone raves about this place, so we finally tried it. It was fine, but didn’t blow us away. Crust was good but the sauce was bland. Probably wouldn’t go out of our way again."
Late-night lifesaver,2024-04-18,4,"Open till midnight, which is rare around here. Got slices after a concert and they were crispy, hot, and satisfying. Not gourmet, but hit the spot."
Cheese overload,2024-05-12,2,"They pile on so much cheese that it’s overwhelming. Every bite was just a chewy mass. Needed better balance with sauce and toppings."
Loved the vegan pesto,2024-03-29,5,"Tried their vegan pesto pizza with almond ricotta. Absolutely delicious — bright, fresh, and didn’t feel like a compromise at all."
Crust burnt beyond char,2024-04-06,1,"Char is one thing, but our pizza came out black on the bottom and bitter. Had to peel everything off the crust just to eat it."
Ideal lunch specials,2024-06-04,4,"Their weekday lunch deal gets you a personal pizza and a soda for $9. Fast service, solid quality — perfect quick work lunch."
Excellent craft beer pairings,2024-05-15,5,"The bartender suggested pairing our sausage pizza with a citrusy IPA and it was a revelation. They really know how to elevate the experience."
Pizza fell apart,2024-03-25,2,"Crust was so thin it couldn’t hold the toppings — everything slid off and we ended up eating it with forks. Disappointing execution."
Best garlic knots in town,2024-04-09,5,"Don’t miss their garlic knots. Soft, fluffy, soaked in butter and garlic with a dusting of parmesan. Could make a meal of these alone."
Unpleasant sauce flavor,2024-05-19,2,"The tomato sauce had an odd metallic tang, like it was stored too long. Overpowered everything else. Couldn’t finish."
Perfect for sports fans,2024-06-06,4,"Plenty of big screens, friendly crowd, pitchers of beer. Their meat lover’s pizza is heavy but perfect game day fuel."
Surprisingly light deep dish,2024-05-26,5,"Their deep dish doesn’t sit like a brick in your stomach. Airy crust, tangy sauce on top, cheese layered underneath. Textbook execution."
Hit-or-miss consistency,2024-04-15,3,"Some days it’s amazing, other days just mediocre. Seems to depend on who’s working the oven. Wish they’d tighten quality control."
Incredible fig and goat cheese pie,2024-05-31,5,"Sweet figs, tangy goat cheese, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. An elegant combo that’s still totally comforting. Would order again in a heartbeat."
Under-seasoned toppings,2024-03-27,3,"The veggies and sausage needed more salt or spice — everything tasted flat. Crust was decent, but the toppings were underwhelming."
Outstanding service,2024-06-03,5,"We had a mistake on our order and they not only fixed it quickly, but comped our drinks. Everyone was so nice. Will definitely come back."
Too chewy to enjoy,2024-04-24,2,"Crust was so tough it felt like chewing through rubber. By the end, my jaw hurt more than I enjoyed the pizza."
Charming neighborhood spot,2024-03-19,4,"Small, cozy, friendly staff who remember your name. Pizza is reliably good, especially the simple margherita."
Drowned in balsamic,2024-05-10,2,"A little balsamic can be great — this was more like a soup. Completely overpowered the delicate toppings. Disappointed."
Perfect pepperoni curls,2024-06-05,5,"They use the small, spicy pepperoni that curl into little cups with crispy edges. Each bite had a pop of salty, savory flavor."
Overpriced for the quality,2024-04-21,3,"$26 for a basic large pie felt steep considering the dough was bland and the cheese didn’t stretch or melt properly. Expected better for the price."
Ideal for large groups,2024-05-02,5,"They easily handled our party of 14. Huge shareable pizzas, fast service, and everyone left happy. Great for celebrations."
Cold in the center,2024-03-31,2,"Edges were hot, center was lukewarm with half-melted cheese. Suggests uneven cooking. Not acceptable."
Beautiful seasonal special,2024-06-02,5,"Spring pizza with ramps, asparagus, and lemon zest was a knockout. Bright, fresh, and a nice change from heavier options."
Generic pizza place,2024-04-05,3,"Nothing bad, nothing memorable. If you’re nearby it’s fine, but wouldn’t drive across town for it."
Extraordinary caramelized onion pie,2024-05-28,5,"The sweet caramelized onions with sharp gorgonzola and a sprinkle of walnuts made for a phenomenal sweet-savory combo."
Greasy mess,2024-04-13,2,"The pizza was so oily it soaked through the box onto our counter. Hard to taste anything beyond grease."
Inventive specials every month,2024-06-07,5,"Love that they switch up their specialty pizzas — just tried a smoked salmon, dill, and crème fraîche pie that was basically pizza lox. Delicious."
Not enough sauce,2024-05-09,3,"Their crust is nice but they’re stingy with sauce. Made each bite feel dry and under-flavored."
Effortless NY fold,2024-04-27,5,"Their slices fold perfectly without cracking, just like the best NYC spots. Thin, chewy, with the right touch of grease."
Soggy bottom,2024-05-13,2,"Crust was totally limp under the toppings. Had to eat it with a fork, which kind of defeats the point of pizza."
Perfect, 2025-12-03,5,"Me and my friend loved this place. We had perfect service. We will be coming back"
